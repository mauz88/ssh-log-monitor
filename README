- Summarizes failed and successful login sessions.
- Provides timestamped event details for monitoring and auditing.
- Easy to extend and customize for additional log formats or alerting.

## Project Structure

- `ssh_log_monitor.py`: Main Python script for parsing SSH logs.
- `sample_ssh_log.log`: Sample SSH log file used for testing and development.
- `README.md`: Project documentation and overview.

## Usage
